# Telnet-configuration-on-a-router-in-packet-tracer
Hello !! We will do a small configuration of telnet in packet tracer. Telnet is an application layer protocol which used to get remote access or CLI based device i.e. Router. It uses TCP port number 23.
In real production environment, telnet can not be used because data packet information can be seen clearly in the form of text so that's the reason it not recommended from the security point of view.
We can use it for testing or practice purpose.
